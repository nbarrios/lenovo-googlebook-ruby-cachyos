# Install Ruby's Intel Sensor Hub firmware on an installed system. Reads (never
# writes) the factory `super` partition to obtain Google's ISH firmware from
# vendor_a; the proprietary file is not shipped in this repository.
#
# linux-firmware only has Intel's generic ish_ptl.bin, which exposes placeholder
# HID sensors that always read 0. With Google's board file the ISH runs ChromeOS
# EC firmware: cros_ec_ishtp registers it and cros-ec-light exposes the ambient
# light sensor. The kernel picks the file by name (CRC32 of "Google" and "Ruby").
# Also blacklists acpi_als, the firmware's ACPI light sensor, which always reads 0.
